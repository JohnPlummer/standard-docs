# Analyze Project Documentation

You are tasked with analyzing the current project documentation to assess its quality, completeness, and accuracy.

## Your Task

1. **Review existing documentation** for completeness and accuracy
2. **Identify gaps and inconsistencies** in the current documentation
3. **Assess documentation quality** against best practices
4. **Provide recommendations** for improvements

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Documentation Inventory
- List all existing documentation files
- Categorize documents by purpose (setup, reference, guides, etc.)
- Note last update dates and freshness
- Identify missing standard documentation

### 2. Content Analysis
For each document:
- **Accuracy**: Verify information against current codebase
- **Completeness**: Check if all relevant information is covered
- **Clarity**: Assess if content is clear and well-structured
- **Usefulness**: Evaluate practical value for developers
- **Currency**: Check if information is up-to-date

### 3. Gap Analysis
Identify missing documentation:
- **Essential docs**: PROJECT_OVERVIEW, DEVELOPMENT_SETUP, etc.
- **Project-specific docs**: API_REFERENCE, COMPONENT_LIBRARY, etc.
- **Process docs**: Deployment, troubleshooting, contributing
- **Technical docs**: Architecture, database schema, etc.

### 4. Quality Assessment
Rate documentation on:
- **Completeness** (1-10): How much of the project is documented
- **Accuracy** (1-10): How well docs match current codebase
- **Usability** (1-10): How helpful docs are for developers
- **Maintenance** (1-10): How well docs are maintained
