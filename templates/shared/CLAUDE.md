## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Before Making Any Changes
1. **Read project-overview.md** to understand the project's purpose and architecture
2. **Check development-setup.md** for project-specific setup and commands
3. **Review key-components.md** to understand how components relate to each other
4. **Look at recent-changes.md** to understand recent project evolution

### When Adding Features
1. **Follow established patterns** found in key-components.md
2. **Update relevant documentation** - don't leave docs out of sync
3. **Check deployment-guide.md** if changes affect deployment
4. **Add any new issues to troubleshooting.md** if they might affect others

### When Fixing Bugs
